Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

Synopsis:

This project introduces functions-and-nested-loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while 
the holberton.h file contains all the expeceted function prototypes.

Description of what each file does:

0. Prints "Holberton"
1. Prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3. Checks for lowercase character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
4. Checks for alphabetic character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
5. Prints the sign of a number
6. Computes the absolute value of an integer
7. Prints the last digit of a number
8. Prints every minute starting from 00:00 to 23:59
9. Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
10. Adds two integers and returns the result
11. Prints all natural numbers from n to 98
12. Prints the n times table, starting with 0
13. Computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
14. Prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
15. Considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this program finds and prints 
    the sum of the even-valued terms
16. Finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
