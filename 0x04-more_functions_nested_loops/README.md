More functions, more nested loops
=================================

Requirements:
==============

Language: C
OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc 

Synopsis:
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal was to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts Iwas able to gained a deeper understanding of following:
Nested loops and how to use them
Functions and how to use functions
Difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
A prototype
Scope of variables
Header files and how to to use them with #include

Description of what each file does:
0. a function that checks for uppercase character
1. a function that checks for a digit 0 - 9
2. a function that multiplies two integers
3. a function that prints the numbers 0-9
4. a function that prints the numbers 0-9 and skips 2 and 4
5. a function that prints 10 times the numbers 0-14
6. a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, print "_" n times
7. a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, print "\" n times
8. a function that prints a square, using #
9. a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and 
   "FizzBuzz" for numbers which are multiples of both three and five
10. a function that prints a triangle with # based on size argument
11. a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143
12. a function that prints an integer
